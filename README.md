### Analysis Report:
## Code Review: add.js

**1. Change Summary:**

*   Added a new file `add.js` containing a simple addition function.

**2. Impact Assessment:**

*   Introduces a new module that can be used for performing addition operations. Potential impact is low as it's a standalone, basic function.

**3. Quality Check:**

*   Code is straightforward and readable.
*   A basic test case would improve confidence in its correctness (e.g., `expect(add(1,2)).toBe(3);`).
*   Consider adding JSDoc comments to clearly document the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.

**4. Security Notes:**

*   No apparent security concerns as it's a simple arithmetic operation. However, be mindful of potential overflow issues if very large numbers are used (this is a general concern with addition, not specific to this code).

**5. Suggestions:**

*   **Add a test case:**  Create a test file (e.g., `add.test.js`) and verify the function's behavior with different inputs.
*   **Add JSDoc comments:**  Include descriptive comments above the function definition to improve maintainability.  Example:

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Adds two numbers together.
     * @param {number} a The first number.
     * @param {number} b The second number.
     * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
     */
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }

    module.exports = add;
    ```
